# Hi, I'm Altan 👋

I'm working on artificial intelligence, LLM, NLP, Agent, Data Science. Currently, I’m actively working on various AI and data science projects, constantly learning and applying cutting-edge technologies. I completed short-term and long-term internships at Turkcell. After the internships, I continued working part-time at Turkcell for about 5 months. During this time, I worked in the Network Technologies team, focusing on data science tasks such as data analysis, data simplification, preprocessing, and visualization. 
I'm developing NLP projects and AI Agents. I create AI Agent for personal needs. I developed many models use fine-tune method. I'm enhancing my skills about AI, LLM and generating Agent. 

## What I Work On 🚀
- 🎓 I graduated as the second top student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Afyon Kocatepe University (2024).
- 🖥️ I worked as an intern and part-time data scientist in the Turkcell Network Technologies team.
- 💡 My thesis project involved developing an object detection application using deep learning.
- 🔍 I’m passionate about leveraging AI for innovative solutions, especially in fields like networking, finance, technology, information technologies and telecommunications.
- 🔬 Researching and developing LLM-based AI agents for automation and intelligent decision-making.
- 🤖 I enjoy developing machine learning and deep learning models and find it very rewarding.
- 🧠 Creating and fine-tuning AI-powered applications for real-world use cases. I created different agents and ai models for personal needs. Building NLP models for text classification, sentiment analysis, and language understanding.
- 👥 Working with a team is a great source of motivation for me, and I truly enjoy collaborative environments.
